 Computer Classification with Naive Bayes
 Description

This project involves building and evaluating a Naive Bayes classifier to predict outcomes based on features from a computer dataset. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, standardized, and used to train and test a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier. The performance of the classifier is evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix metrics.

Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Training a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier
- Evaluating the classifier's performance using accuracy and confusion matrix

 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
